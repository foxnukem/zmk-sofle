### Sofle Keymap
<img src="keymap-drawer/eyelash_sofle.svg" >

### Running the Workflow
The repository has a GitHub workflow that leverages the zmkfirmware/zmk repository to build the firmware. The workflow will build the firmware and upload it as an artifact to the repository.
The workflow is triggered on push, pull_request, and manually via workflow_dispatch. You can trigger the workflow manually by going to the Actions tab in your forked repository and selecting the workflow.

### Workflow Artifact
Once the workflow has completed, you can download the artifact from the Actions tab. The artifact will be a .zip file that contains the firmware. Extract the .zip file in your
local directory. The extracted files will include:
- `sofle_right-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2`
- `sofle_left-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2`
- `settings_reset-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2`

### Flashing the keymap and firmware
#### Steps to ensure successful flashing
- Keep in mind that the power switch on the wireless Ergomech Sofle V2 is only **one** of the ways that the keyboard can be powered. The other way is to plug in the USB-C cable.
When flashing one side of the keyboard, the other side must be off. 
- The keyboard must be in bootloader mode to flash the firmware. To enter the bootloader mode, press the "BOOT" button twice in quick succession. 
- If you are having trouble flashing, you can always flash the `settings_reset-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2` file first. This is a good way to make sure 
that the keyboard is in a known state before flashing the firmware. The `reset` flash can be visually confirmed by the screen on the Nice!Nano microcontroller 
not displaying anything after the flash is complete.

#### Flashing Order
There is no required order to flash the firmware. You can flash the left or right side first. Assuming that you are attempting to flash the sides with the correct
file (i.e. the right side with the `sofle_right-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2` file), you may find it helpful to follow the following order:
1. Confirm both sides of the keyboard are off.
2. Flash the right side of the keyboard, unplug the USB-C cable, and set it aside.
3. Flash the left side of the keyboard, leaving it plugged in after.
4. Turn on the right side of the keyboard. You should see the screen on the Nice!Nano microcontroller light up and display a checkmark next to the wifi icon if the sides have connected.
5. Open you favorite text editor and test the keyboard.


#### Flashing the firmware
1. Connect the keyboard to your computer via USB-C cable.
2. Press the "BOOT" button twice in quick succession to enter bootloader mode.
3. The keyboard should appear as a USB drive on your computer.
4. Drag and drop the `uf2` file that coincides with the side of the keyboard you are flashing onto the USB drive that represents the keyboard.
5. The keyboard will automatically reboot and the new firmware will be flashed.

**Note:** Some operating systems may show a failure when the keyboard reboots, or the USB drive may disappear. This is normal and the keyboard should be flashed successfully.
The keyboard flashing has been confirmed to work successfully on Windows 10, and Linux.
